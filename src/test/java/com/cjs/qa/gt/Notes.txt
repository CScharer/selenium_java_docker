Per Mark Ford:
I see the process working like this:
1.	Staff will create the YM event and the corresponding GTW event.
2.	Staff will tag the YM event with the GTW event id.  This might be in an event field or in the description as a tag.  We may need Julanne to help with that unless Stephanie has an idea.
3.	Your process will run once a day and do the following:
a.	Query YM to get all active events that haven't occurred yet
b.	Check each of those events for the GTW event id
c.	For those active YM events with a GTW id that haven't yet occurred:
i.	Get the list of registrants for the YM event
ii.	Get the list of registrants for the corresponding GTW event
iii.	If any are in the YM event but not the GTW event, add them to the GTW event
I've done a lot with JSON at work lately so if you need any help with that, just let me know.
Thanks again for working on this.
I have not had time and this will be a huge help to Stephanie, Rhonda, and team.
