# GitHub Pages Setup for Allure Reports

This guide will help you enable GitHub Pages to view your Allure test reports online.

---

## 🎯 What You Get

Once enabled, your Allure reports will be automatically published at:

**https://cscharer.github.io/selenium_java_docker/**

Every push to the `main` branch will:
1. Run tests in CI/CD
2. Generate fresh Allure report
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Keep historical trend data

---

## 📋 One-Time Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub:
   ```
   https://github.com/CScharer/selenium_java_docker
   ```

2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)

3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")

4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **Deploy from a branch**
   - **Branch**: Select **`gh-pages`** and **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **Save**

5. Wait 1-2 minutes for the initial deployment

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

1. Visit the GitHub Pages URL:
   ```
   https://cscharer.github.io/selenium_java_docker/
   ```

2. You should see the Allure report with:
   - 📊 Overview dashboard
   - 📈 Graphs (Status, Severity, Duration)
   - ✅ Test results from latest CI run
   - 📸 Screenshots attached to each test
   - 📉 Historical trends (after multiple runs)

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push to main] --> B[GitHub Actions Runs]
    B --> C[Tests Execute]
    C --> D[Allure Results Generated]
    D --> E[Allure Report Built]
    E --> F[Deploy to gh-pages Branch]
    F --> G[Live on GitHub Pages]
```

### What Happens on Each Push

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` or `develop` branch
2. **Build**: Compile Java code
3. **Test**: Run tests on Chrome and Firefox in parallel
4. **Collect**: Gather `*-result.json` files from both browsers
5. **Merge**: Combine results into single dataset
6. **Generate**: Create Allure HTML report
7. **Deploy**: Push to `gh-pages` branch (main branch only)
8. **Publish**: GitHub Pages serves the report

  - Severity distribution
  - Duration trend
  - Flaky tests detection

### Suites Page
- All test suites organized by package

## 🔍 Monitoring CI/CD Runs

### Check Workflow Status

1. **Actions Tab**:
   ```
   https://github.com/CScharer/selenium_java_docker/actions
   ```

2. Look for **"Selenium Grid CI/CD Pipeline"** workflow

3. Click on the latest run to see:
   - ✅ Build & Compile
   - ✅ Grid Tests - chrome
   - ✅ Grid Tests - firefox
   - ✅ Generate Allure Report
   - ✅ Code Quality Analysis
   - ✅ Docker Build Test
   - ✅ Test Summary

### Verify Allure Results Generated

In the workflow run, check the **"Debug test results"** step:

```bash
# Should show:
✅ target/allure-results/ exists
✅ *-result.json files found (3+ files per browser)
✅ *-attachment.png files found (screenshots)
✅ *-container.json files found (structure)
```

### Download Artifacts (Alternative Method)

If you want to view the report locally:

1. Scroll to **Artifacts** section at bottom of workflow run
2. Click **"allure-report"** to download
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Open `index.html` in your browser

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Report Shows 404s or "Loading..."

**Cause**: No Allure result files were generated during test execution.

**Solution**:
1. Check the **"Debug test results"** step in GitHub Actions
2. Verify `*-result.json` files exist in `target/allure-results/`
3. Ensure tests are running with TestNG suite XML:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng-ci-suite.xml
   ```
4. Confirm `testng-ci-suite.xml` has `<listeners>` section:
   ```xml
   <listeners>
       <listener class-name="io.qameta.allure.testng.AllureTestNg"/>
   </listeners>
   ```

### GitHub Pages Shows 404 (Page Not Found)

**Cause**: `gh-pages` branch doesn't exist yet.

**Solution**:
1. Wait for first CI run to complete (creates `gh-pages` branch)
2. Then enable GitHub Pages in Settings
3. Refresh after 1-2 minutes

### Report Not Updating

**Cause**: GitHub Pages cache.

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Or add `?refresh=timestamp` to URL

### Deployment Permission Denied

**Cause**: Workflow doesn't have write permissions.

**Solution**: Already configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Required for GitHub Pages deployment
```

---

## 📈 Historical Trends

After multiple CI runs, you'll see:
- **Trend graphs** showing test stability over time
- **Flaky test detection** - tests that sometimes fail
- **Duration trends** - performance regressions
- **History** - Previous report data preserved

The `keep_files: false` setting ensures each deployment is fresh, but Allure's built-in history mechanism preserves trend data in the report itself.
