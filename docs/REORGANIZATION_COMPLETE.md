## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED

### Before (Flat Structure):
```
docs/
├── 28 .md files (all in one folder)

### After (Organized Structure):
```
docs/
├── 3 root files (NAVIGATION.md, README.md, CHANGE.log)
├── 6 main folders
├── 7 subfolders
└── Clear organization by purpose
```
**Benefits**: Easy navigation, clear lifecycle, logical grouping
